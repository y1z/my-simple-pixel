	// We need to cast this pointer to the actual type that it points to
	// There are several types of casting available in Godot

	// 1. Static cast (normal C++ feature)
	// -- only use this if you FOR SURE KNOW THE ACTUAL TYPE
	// -- if someone passes something other than the type you think it is, you will get instant error
	// -- fastest cast you can do is this, because this cast is executed at compile time

	//     if (player) {
	//         player->some_player_method(); // Access Player-specific method
	//     }
	// }

	// 2. Dynamic cast (normal C++ feature)
	// -- use when you are not sure of the type it actually holds
	// -- handle cases for different types
	// -- slower than static cast, because this cast is executed at runtime

	// Player *player = dynamic_cast<Player *>(instance); // Safe runtime check
	// if (player) {
	// 	player->some_player_method(); // Only called if cast succeeds
	// } else {
	// 	// Handle invalid cast (e.g., instance is not a Player)
	// }

	// 3. Object::cast_to  (Godot specific runtime cast)
	// -- use when working with Godotâ€™s Object type
	// -- still a runtime cast so slower than static_cast
	// -- useful for casting Variant to another godot specific type
