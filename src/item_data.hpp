// WARNING: All this code is tested on Godot 4.4.1, on each godot-cpp branch release there might be changes to the API

// WARNING: In every .hpp file that you make, always include "#pragma once" at the top of the file (or use the old way with include guards)
// This will prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file (without it, you would get errors when compiling)
#pragma once

// A single .hpp file should contain class declarations and method signatures
// For each .hpp file you should have a corresponding .cpp file where you place the method definitions (implementing the actual logic of the methods)

// More advanced devs might use the templates C++ feature (like Generics in C# but more powerful)
// or want to forcefully inline methods,
// only then you would put the method definitions in the .hpp file

// Include necessary Godot headers. If you ever want to use a Godot class, you need to include its header file here
// By holding CTRL and clicking on it, you will see the class declaration and all the functions that it has
// If you want to see implementations you can always check godot's source code on GitHub
#include <godot_cpp/variant/typed_array.hpp> // Added for Godot arrays
#include <godot_cpp/classes/node.hpp> // Added for Node
#include <godot_cpp/classes/packed_scene.hpp> // Added for PackedScene
#include <godot_cpp/classes/resource.hpp> // Added for Resource
// If you are using the Clangd language server and using my setup script to compile,
// it will automatically suggest the correct headers to include when you type a class name (because of the generated compile_commands.json file)

// The actual VS Code extensions you need for smooth development
// "llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd",  -> clangd, it will also prompt you to download the language server automatically
// "ms-python.python", -> just a python extension if you need to edit the SConstruct someday
// "amiralizadeh9480.cpp-helper" -> allows you to right click on a method declaration in the .hpp and create implementations in the .cpp file fast
// You might also want to install github actions extension if you plan on editing the build-plugin.yml file

//
// Microsoft's extension for C++ is not that great, if you have that, disable it and install Clangd along with its language server
// If you still insist on using something other than Clangd (which reads the compile_commands.json),
// then you might need to setup the include paths correctly

// ${workspaceFolder}/godot-cpp/gdextension/
// ${workspaceFolder}/godot-cpp/gen/**
// ${workspaceFolder}/godot-cpp/include/**
// ${workspaceFolder}/godot-cpp/src/**
// ${workspaceFolder}/src   -> usually where you write all your code, but you might separate it into src/ and include/ dirs (check Sconstruct file)
//

// If you are inexperienced with C++
// A good workflow might be writing your logic in GDScript first and ensuring it works as expected,
// and then writing the C++ equivalent of it (or using AI to help you with that)

// If you run into linking issues when making custom classes, make sure you don't have a situation where
// header file A includes B, and B includes A, because that will cause a circular dependency
// Use forward declarations inside the header if necessary and combine that with pointers
// (avoid references since Godot constructors are weird and they have limitations, for constructors use your own setup functions)

// For header files that are completely yours use double quotes, like this: #include "my_header.hpp"
// For header files that are from Godot or other libraries use angle brackets, like this: #include <godot_cpp/classes/resource.hpp>
// Clangd sometimes might suggest you to use double quotes for Godot headers, but you should always use angle brackets, be consistent

// It is usually a VERY BAD practice to use "using namespace;" in header files (.hpp)
// because it can cause name conflicts, but since we are not working with other libraries, we will not have any issues with it
// WARNING: Always include this code in both your .hpp and .cpp files, so that you can use the classes without prefixing them with "godot::"
using namespace godot;

// class ExampleClass;
// this is a forward declaration, we just tell C++
// "Hey, we have a class that we are going to be using and it's called ExampleClass
// I'll supply the implementation later, by including the header inside the .cpp file only, that way I avoid circular dependencies"

// You can inherit from other classes, like Node, Node2D, Node3D, even MultiMeshInsance2D etc...
// That would actually allow you to place your custom class inside the scene tree, so you can use it like any other node
// and you will have functions like _ready(), _process(), _physics_process() etc...

// WARNING: Each time you make a change, you should always recompile the project
// You can always use my setup script for that or just run "scons compiledb=yes" in the terminal
// The compiledb=yes flag will generate a compile_commands.json file that you can use with Clangd for better autocompletion and error checking
// If you rely on include directories, you can just run the "scons" command

// WARNING: When you make a class that you want to use in Godot, you have to also register it in the `register_types.cpp` file

// Node: If you are tired of using print statements to debug and you want an actual debugger
// you can compile your code using the "scons debug_symbols=yes compiledb=yes" command
// (this command might change depending on godot-cpp version and also prevents optimized builds)
// and after that run your game and attach the debugger to the Godot process (the correct one, since you have an editor process and game process)
// As long as you don't inline functions forcefully, you will be able to set breakpoints and step through your code

// Note: You are also free to make PURE C++ classes, that you can use internally (won't be exposed in GDScript),
// but then you should handle memory management yourself

// Note: if you prefer working with 2 separate directories for .hpp and .cpp files, you can do that as well
// Just edit the SConstruct file - search for "# Directory for headers"/ "includes" to see the code there and change "src" to "include"
